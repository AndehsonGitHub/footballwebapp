                    Luton have insofar had an excellent first season back in the Premier League. Pinned as relegation fodder 
                    before a ball was even kicked, Luton now find themselves firmly in the fight for survival. Albiet, a 10 
                    point deduction awarded to Everton followed by sanctions towards Nottingham Forest has certianly made the
                    situation far more tenable.

                    <p>For those that are curious, 11th place is Wolverhamton Wanderers with 35 points. An impressive haul
                        considering the early season predictions suggesting that they would struggle. A small ode to 
                        Gary O'Niel and the wonderful work he is doing with such a thin yet talented squad. </p>   

                    <p>With that in mind you can perhaps see my reasoning for not including them in this table of possible relegation 
                        candidates. Though some of you may still be puzzled by my inclusion of Fulham and Bournemouth; 9 points is 
                        a surmountable gap. Though it is unlikely that they would fall to such lows, I thought I would include it 
                        with the mind of covering all basis. </p>

                    <p>Let's go through all 9 teams, discussing their season so far and predicting their final league position
                        with only 11 games to go.</p>
