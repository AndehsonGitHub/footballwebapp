                So, here we are! Finally I've implemented a working NavBar to some pretty aesthetic results!
				Thank god for <a href="https://concrete.style/">concrete.css</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The plan from here on out is to slowly add content and have the "buttons" appear as titles. 
				Will probably soon change the buttons to have labouriously long titles.
